To access the MR data, follow the VRTK instructions found at https://academy.vrtk.io/Documentation/HowToGuides/CameraRigs/ in order to set up the trackedAliases corresponding to the Windows MR controllers. Then, create a new object in unity and attach the script RecordTrackedAlias to it. Add that object to the scene, and the data will be sent through SMOOTH.
